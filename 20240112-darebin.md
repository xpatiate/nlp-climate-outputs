## Purpose of action
### With regard to 'purpose of action': Does the document explicitly define 'climate emergency' and if so, how?
* __Positive__: True
* __Answer__: Yes, the document does explicitly define 'climate emergency'. It refers to climate emergency in two ways. Firstly, it refers to the state of emergency due to the unprecedented rate of global warming, melting polar ice caps, rising sea levels, and undermining food and water security. Secondly, it refers to a specific approach to tackling climate change, which involves taking urgent and appropriate action to respond to the climate emergency.
* __Quote__: Climate Emergency: Climate Emergency refers both to the state of emergency described  in section 3, and to a specific approach to tackling climate change, i.e

Key direction # 1 – Climate Emergency mobilisation and leadership
6.1.1 Context
“The unprecedented rate of global 
warming is melting the polar ice caps, 
raising sea levels and undermining food 
and water security for many of the 
world’s peoples. Action has been too 
slow, because economics has trumped 
physics. Now emergency action is the 
only rational response.” – David Spratt, 
co-author of Climate Code Red.
The scale and speed of transformation 
needed to change our energy markets, 
our economy, our legislation and our 
behaviour to eliminate greenhouse gas 
emissions and draw down the excess  
CO2 in the atmosphere requires a national 
and global emergency response. 
To do this we need to build a broad

## Restoring a safe climate
### With regard to 'restoring a safe climate': Does the plan include specific actions for mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, including technological solutions and behaviour change? If so, please list as many as possible.
* __Positive__: True
* __Answer__: Yes, the plan does include specific actions for mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, both through technological solutions and behavior change. The plan outlines actions such as the installation of solar panels and home insulation to reduce energy use, recycling food waste through composting to reduce organic waste to landfill and associated greenhouse gas emissions, and growing and sourcing food locally to reduce reliance on the greenhouse-gas-intensive globalised food system. The plan also encourages residents to take practical actions to help restore a safe climate and adapt to climate change. Moreover, the plan emphasizes the importance of energy efficiency and renewable energy, and includes the goal of transitioning to 100% renewable energy as soon as possible.

ability to share our own models of success with 
others, and learn from the experiences and 
innovations of councils around Australia and the

and committing to the actions that will restore a 
safe climate for current and future generations.
