# Attribute 1: Purpose of action
## (a) Think about how the document addresses 'purpose of action'. Does the document define 'climate emergency' and if so, how?

## Answer
Short answer: 0: Not at all

Long answer: The document does not address the concept of 'climate emergency' at all. It is a vehicle registration form issued by VicRoads, the road and traffic authority in the state of Victoria, Australia. The form outlines the requirements for vehicle registration, including evidence of identity, vehicle specifications, and payment details. It does not contain any information or statements regarding climate change, climate emergencies, or related actions.

Excerpt: N/A

Explanation: There is no excerpt related to 'climate emergency' in the document because the document does not address this issue.

## (b) Think about how the document addresses 'purpose of action'. Is climate action the core purpose or goal of the policy?

## Answer
Short answer: 0: Not at all

Long answer: The document does not address the topic of climate action at all. It is primarily concerned with the process and requirements for vehicle registration, with no mention of any actions or policies related to climate change or environmental sustainability. 

Excerpt: "Vehicle registration...The Vehicle Register is not a register of vehicle ownership (title)...What type of registration are you applying for? (please cross where applicable)..."

Explanation: This excerpt is relevant because it demonstrates the primary focus of the document, which is vehicle registration. There is no mention of climate action or related policies, indicating that this is not a goal or purpose of the policy outlined in the document.

## (c) Think about how the document addresses 'purpose of action'. Does the document explain the need for action on climate change?

## Answer
Short answer: 0: Not at all

Long answer: The document does not address the subject of climate change at all. It is a form for vehicle registration and related matters, and does not contain any information or policies related to climate change or environmental concerns. The document is focused on the legal and administrative aspects of vehicle registration, and does not discuss the environmental impact of vehicles or any actions to mitigate this.

Excerpt: No relevant excerpt, as the document does not mention climate change.

Explanation: There is no mention of climate change or related topics in the document, so it does not address the need for action on climate change in any way.

## (d) Think about how the document addresses 'purpose of action'. Does the document plainly state who is responsible for action?

## Answer
Short answer: 3: Thoroughly

Long answer: The document thoroughly states who is responsible for action. It clearly outlines that the applicant or agent is responsible for the information provided in the form and for the vehicle. It also states that the applicant takes full responsibility for any loss, damage or claim caused by any false statement or misrepresentation made on the declaration. 

Excerpt: "By signing this form, the applicant or agent declares that: the information in this form and related supporting documents is true, correct and complete... the applicant takes full responsibility for any loss, damage or claim caused by any false statement or misrepresentation made on this declaration."

Explanation: This excerpt is relevant because it explicitly states who is responsible for the action, which in this case is the applicant or agent. They are responsible for the information provided and for any consequences that may arise from providing false or misleading information.
