## Purpose of action
### With regard to 'purpose of action': Does the document define 'climate emergency' and if so, how?
* __Positive__: True
* __Answer__: Yes, the document does define 'climate emergency'. It refers to it both as a state of emergency due to the unprecedented rate of global warming and its effects, and as a specific approach to tackling climate change. The document emphasizes that 'business as usual' and incremental improvements will not effect enough change quickly enough. It advocates for moving into emergency mode, as is done in times of crisis. The document outlines that there are actions that can be taken together to secure a safe climate for current and future generations.
* __Quote__: Climate Emergency: Climate Emergency refers both to the state of emergency described in section 3, and to a specific approach to tackling climate change, i.e. climate change and restoring a safe climate is to move into emergency mode, as we do in times of crisis. ‘Business as usual’ and incremental improvements will not effect enough change quickly enough.

climate change and restoring a safe 
climate is to move into emergency mode, 
as we do in times of crisis. ‘Business as 
usual’ and incremental improvements will 
not effect enough change quickly 
enough.
There are actions we can take together  
to secure a safe climate for current and 
future generations – there are historical 
precedents for the kind of transformation 
a Climate Emergency response requires. 
One example of “the successful execution 
of change with a comparable level of 
complexity, scale and speed … is the 
economic transformation and mobilisation 
carried out during World War II”.11
This plan sets out Council’s commitments 
to contribute to this rapid transformation.

### With regard to 'purpose of action': Is climate action the core purpose or goal of the policy?
* __Positive__: True
* __Answer__: Yes, climate action is the core purpose or goal of the policy. The Darebin Climate Emergency Plan outlines various strategies and actions to tackle climate change. It aims to provide maximum protection for the community, restore a safe climate by eliminating greenhouse gas emissions, encourage research to find safe ways to protect people, species and civilization from near-term dangerous temperatures, and enable the community to be resilient in the face of climate change. The policy also highlights the importance of community engagement and cooperation with other councils and organizations to mobilize state and federal governments to act on the climate emergency.
* __Quote__: The Darebin Climate Emergency Plan overarching goals informed by Council’s Climate Emergency commitment and consultation with the community are: to provide maximum protection for the community of Darebin and for people, civilisation and species globally, especially the most vulnerable to restore a safe climate at emergency speed by eliminating greenhouse gas emissions and enabling drawdown of excess carbon dioxide in the air to encourage research to find safe ways to protect people, species and civilisation from near-term dangerous temperatures, while zero emission and carbon dioxide drawdown strategies are being enacted to enable our community to be resilient in the face of climate change.

### With regard to 'purpose of action': Does the document explain the need for action on climate change?
* __Positive__: True
* __Answer__: The document does explain the need for action on climate change. It emphasizes the urgency of the situation, referring to it as a 'climate emergency'. The document states that the effects of climate change, such as more frequent heatwaves and floods, are already built into the climate system, and that society must transform to support a safe climate. The document also asserts that action has been too slow, and that emergency action is now the only rational response. It highlights the need for local, ground-up action, particularly given the perceived insufficiency of action by national and state governments. The document also acknowledges the need to prepare for the effects of climate change and to improve resilience to future changes.
* __Quote__: The onset of the global climate emergency together with many years of insufficient action by the national and state governments are making targets difficult to achieve and making local ground-up action more important. We must aim to do as much as we possibly can, as quickly as possible and bring all levels of government and our community with us. We also recognise the need to ensure that we are well prepared for the effects of built-in climate change, such as more frequent heatwaves and floods.
