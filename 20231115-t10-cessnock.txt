## Answer
Short answer: 0: Not at all

Long answer: The document does not directly address the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities or discuss who is likely to be first and worst impacted by climate change.

Context: No specific quote available.

Explanation: Throughout the context provided, there is no mention of vulnerable communities or any indication of the policy addressing who may be most affected by climate change. The policy mainly focuses on principles and strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving energy efficiency, and building resilience to climate change, but does not delve into the social justice aspects of climate change impact.

## Answer
Short answer: 1: Partially

Long answer: The document does not explicitly discuss the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities, but it does emphasize the importance of shared responsibility across all levels of government, Council, community and businesses in addressing climate change and transitioning towards a net zero emissions region. It also mentions the importance of community initiatives to deal with climate change.

Context: "1.1.3. support community initiatives to deal with climate change;" and "5.1.1.3 Recognise the importance of shared responsibility across all levels of government, Council, community and businesses in addressing climate change and transitioning towards a net zero emissions region."

Explanation: While the document does not directly address the impact on vulnerable communities, it implies that all parts of the community, including potentially vulnerable communities, should be involved in the response to climate change. This suggests a recognition of the need for equity and social justice in responding to climate change, but does not directly address the issues faced by vulnerable communities.

## Answer
Short answer: 1: Partially

Long answer: The document partially discusses the impact of climate change on communities, but it does not specifically mention vulnerable communities who are likely to be the first and worst impacted by climate change. The policy talks about the council's commitment to supporting community initiatives to deal with climate change and their role as a leader for action on climate change. The policy also outlines their dedication to a collaborative decision-making approach, partnering with the community, business, and other stakeholders in planning and implementing climate change actions.

Context: "1.1.3. support community initiatives to deal with climate change; Principle 2: Council adopts a Collaborative Decision Making approach, partnering with the community, business and other stakeholders in planning and implementing climate change actions through learning and shared responsibility."

Explanation: These pieces of context show that the council is committed to supporting the community and working together with various stakeholders to address climate change, but they do not specifically mention the impact on vulnerable communities.

## Answer
Short answer: 0: Not at all

Long answer: The document does not specifically address the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities or discuss who is likely to be the first and worst impacted by climate change.

Context: No specific context.

Explanation: The document has various references to community engagement, planning, and resilience in the face of climate change. However, it does not specifically mention vulnerable communities or the differential impacts of climate change on different demographic groups. The focus is largely on broader community and environmental impacts, as well as strategic planning and risk management at the council level. Therefore, the document does not address the question of equity and social justice in the context of climate change impacts on vulnerable communities.

## Answer
Short answer: 1: Partially

Long answer: The document partially addresses the issue of equity and social justice in relation to climate change. It does this by acknowledging that the council supports the people of the Cessnock LGA and the sustainable, fair and equitable transition to a net zero emissions region. However, it does not specifically discuss the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities.

Context: "Council supports the people of the Cessnock LGA and the sustainable, fair and equitable transition to a net zero emissions region."

Explanation: This statement shows that the council is committed to a fair and equitable transition to a net zero emissions region, which implies a consideration of social justice. However, the document does not explicitly discuss the impact of climate change on specific vulnerable communities or how they will ensure this fair and equitable transition. Therefore, the document only partially addresses the issue of equity and social justice.

## Answer
Short answer: 1: Partially

Long answer: The document acknowledges the need for a fair and equitable transition to a net zero emissions region and reaffirms the principle of inter-generational equity, stating that the present generation should ensure that the health, diversity and productivity of the environment is maintained or enhanced for the benefit of future generations. However, it does not directly address the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities.

Context: "Council supports the people of the Cessnock LGA and the sustainable, fair and equitable transition to a net zero emissions region." and "The principle of inter-generational equity–the present generation should ensure that the health, diversity and productivity of the environment is maintained or enhanced for the benefit of future generations"

Explanation: These quotes indicate that the council is aware of the need for equity in dealing with climate change and that future generations should not be disadvantaged by the actions of the present generation. However, the document does not specifically address how climate change will affect vulnerable communities or how it plans to mitigate these effects, hence the rating of 'partially'.

## Answer
Short answer: 0: Not at all

Long answer: The document does not explicitly discuss the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities or address issues of equity and social justice. The policy focuses on general climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies, without specifying their impacts on different social groups.

Context: "This Policy sets out Council’s position on climate change, the objectives of this Policy are to: ...provide a whole of Council commitment to managing climate change risks within the Cessnock Local Government Area (LGA); support community initiatives to deal with climate change; empower Council as a leader for action on climate change..."

Explanation: While the document mentions supporting community initiatives and managing climate change risks, it does not specifically address the impact of these risks on vulnerable communities or how the initiatives would support social justice or equity.

# Attribute 10: Equity and social justice
## Question 1: Think about how the document addresses equity and social justice. Does the document discuss the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities, who are likely to be the ﬁrst and worst impacted by climate change?

## Answer
Short answer: 0: Not at all

Long answer: The document does not specifically address the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities or discuss social justice issues related to climate change. The focus of the document is primarily on the council's commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve energy efficiency, and build resilience to climate change across the general community.

Context: "This Policy sets out Council’s position on climate change, the objectives of this Policy are to: enable Council to align its operational and strategic planning with NSW State policy; provide a whole of Council commitment to managing climate change risks within the Cessnock Local Government Area (LGA); support community initiatives to deal with climate change; empower Council as a leader for action on climate change."

Explanation: This context gives a summary of the policy's objectives, none of which directly address the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities or social justice issues. While the policy aims to support community initiatives to deal with climate change, it does not specify the need to focus on vulnerable populations.
