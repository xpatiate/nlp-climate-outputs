# Applying the Climate Emergency Attributes framework to a climate policy document

This is an initial pass at applying the questions in the [Climate Emergency Attributes framework](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.uclim.2020.100666) to a local government climate policy. 

It was generated using GPT model 3.5 via langchain, using the [map-reduce QA chain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/chains/additional/question_answering.html#the-map_reduce-chain), with 4000-character chunks of context and customised question and combine prompts. Text from the whole policy document is divided into 4000-character excerpts and stored. For each question, the system selects the four most relevant excerpts and asks GPT the question in relation to each one. GPT returns four answers, including specific quotes from the excerpt and an explanation of its answer. The four answers are then returned to GPT which combines them to produce the overall answer to the question.

The climate policy in this example is [A Framework for Climate Action](https://www.armidaleregional.nsw.gov.au/ArticleDocuments/1136/AI%202021%2002335%20%20CEWG%20Report%20-%2026oct2020-V5-1.pdf.aspx), April 2020.

In this output document, each question is displayed along with the four context excerpts and the answers returned by GPT, followed by the final answer. Only the first few characters of each excerpt are displayed, as the original text can be found in the policy document.
