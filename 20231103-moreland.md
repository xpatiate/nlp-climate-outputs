## Answer
The document does provide some information regarding the 'what' and 'why' of a climate emergency response. It outlines the 'what' by detailing the council's planned actions to achieve a zero carbon Moreland over the next twenty years and the actions the council is taking to reduce its own emissions and influence broader emissions within the community. It also explains the 'why' by highlighting the need to reduce the emissions caused by electricity and gas use, which make up over half of the total emissions in Moreland, and the need to reduce emissions from waste, particularly landfill. However, the document does not offer specific details on what constitutes a climate emergency response, i.e., the specific actions or measures to be taken in response to a climate emergency, nor does it explain why such a response is necessary, i.e., the specific threats or challenges that necessitate a climate emergency response. The document discusses the local government's general plans and strategies for reducing carbon emissions and advocating for environmental sustainability, but does not explicitly frame these as a response to a climate emergency.

## Answer
**Yes**, the document plainly states that responsibility for action lies with various entities. It specifically names the Council as the key body responsible for monitoring and reporting on the implementation of the Zero Carbon Action Plans. It also identifies the Council and the Moreland Energy Foundation Limited (MEFL) as entities leading action and inspiring others. Furthermore, other organizations such as local community groups and advocacy organizations can contribute towards emissions reduction, even if their activities are not directly driven by the document's framework or Council policies. The document also highlights that the Moreland Council has a high level of control over reducing its own operational emissions, reinforcing its central role in addressing climate change.

## Answer
**Yes**, the document does state a clear purpose of action. It outlines the local government's strategic intention for their Zero Carbon Action Plans, which includes the creation of tangible medium-term targets and priority projects and programs. This suggests an actionable approach towards achieving zero carbon emissions. The purpose of the policy is to inspire action towards emissions reduction and to advocate for regulations and policies that support this goal. It emphasizes the need for community engagement and participation in realizing the vision. The document also details a 20-year action plan guided by principles used for decision-making, showing a strategic approach towards a zero carbon Moreland. Lastly, it aims to advocate and act to ensure that emerging technologies are used in a way that benefits the public and the environment, further demonstrating the government's planned actions to address climate change.

## Question 4: Does the document urge rapid action?

## Answer
The document does urge rapid action, as suggested by various parts of the text. It emphasizes the need for quick action in their strategic planning to transition towards a zero carbon community, as indicated by the use of the word "accelerating". The Council's endorsement of a "highly ambitious" target for reducing emissions by 2030 further underscores the call for rapid action. The plan to take action on climate change over the next twenty years also shows an immediate necessity for action. However, the document also indicates a measured, planned approach with input and feedback stages over a period of years, which doesn't suggest an urgent or rapid timeline for action. Therefore, while the document does urge for rapid action in certain aspects, it also emphasizes the importance of a thoughtful and planned approach.

## Question 5: Does the document state that a climate emergency response must be prioritised over policies incompatible with radical decarbonisation?

## Answer
**Yes**, the plan includes comprehensive and far-reaching mitigative efforts to restore a safe, decarbonised climate and rapidly address the causes of the climate emergency. The plan outlines efforts to transition to 100% renewable energy and promote sustainable transport, which directly address two major sources of greenhouse gas emissions: energy production and transportation. Furthermore, the Moreland City Council has set ambitious goals to significantly reduce emissions by 2030, reach net zero by 2035, and achieve negative emissions by 2040. Moreover, the local government plans on implementing a framework that aims to achieve a zero carbon community. This framework will be implemented via five-yearly Zero Carbon Action plans, demonstrating a commitment to a long-term, strategic approach to carbon reduction. While the document does not explicitly state far-reaching mitigative efforts, the outlined strategies and goals indicate a comprehensive approach to addressing the climate emergency.
