## Answer
Short answer: 2: Adequately

Long answer: The document does address the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities. It specifies that elements such as the local aging population and social isolation are likely to contribute to vulnerability and that the community's resilience planning needs to concentrate on these vulnerable sectors. The document also explicitly mentions the need for further research to identify and help vulnerable groups like the elderly, culturally and linguistically diverse communities, and lower socio-economic demographics. However, it does not delve deeply into the specific ways in which these groups are impacted or detailed strategies for supporting them.

Context: "The ageing population and social isolation – 31.7% of residents live in a single/lone person household - are likely to be the two biggest contributors to vulnerability."

Explanation: This context demonstrates that the document recognises the vulnerability of certain segments of the population. It also indicates a need for targeted resilience planning to support these sectors, thereby showing awareness of the unequal impacts of climate change.

## Answer
Short answer: 2: Adequately

Long answer: The document adequately discusses the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities. It recognizes the need for focused resilience planning for vulnerable sectors of the community especially in the face of urban heat, infrastructure outages, and sudden events. It also acknowledges the aging population and social isolation as potential contributors to vulnerability and recognizes the need for more research to identify vulnerable groups.

Context: "Vulnerable sectors of the community will require focused resilience planning especially for urban heat, infrastructure outages and sudden events. Vulnerable residents are expected to be the most exposed and Council will need to activate the community to prepare them and help them to recover from impacts...An ageing population (see Figure 1) will increase the proportion of people in the community that are vulnerable to urban heat, respiratory issues and other chronic and sudden stresses."

Explanation: This context answers the question as it demonstrates the document's recognition of the disproportionate impact of climate change on vulnerable communities. It also shows that the document considers demographic factors such as age and social isolation in its assessment of vulnerability and plans for resilience and adaptation.

## Answer
Short answer: 2: Adequately

Long answer: The document discusses the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities, such as the elderly and socially isolated individuals. It acknowledges the specific risks these groups face, such as vulnerability to urban heat, respiratory issues, and other chronic health problems. The document also mentions the need for focused resilience planning for these vulnerable sectors of the community.

Context: "The ageing population and social isolation – 31.7% of residents live in a single/lone person household - are likely to be the two biggest contributors to vulnerability. An ageing population will increase the proportion of people in the community that are vulnerable to urban heat, respiratory issues and other chronic and sudden stresses. Vulnerable sectors of the community will require focused resilience planning especially for urban heat, infrastructure outages and sudden events."

Explanation: This context demonstrates that the document acknowledges the increased vulnerability of certain populations to the effects of climate change and the need for focused planning and resources for these groups. The document's recognition of these specific risks and focus on resilience planning for vulnerable communities shows an adequate consideration of equity and social justice in climate change impacts.

## Answer
Short answer: 2: Adequately

Long answer: The document adequately discusses the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities. It acknowledges the need for focused resilience planning for these sectors, especially in relation to urban heat, infrastructure outages, and sudden events. It also recognizes the need for further research to identify and quantify more vulnerable groups, including those with pre-existing health conditions, the elderly, culturally and linguistically diverse communities, and lower socio-economic demographics.

Context: "Vulnerable sectors of the community will require focused resilience planning especially for urban heat, infrastructure outages and sudden events. Vulnerable residents are expected to be the most exposed and Council will need to activate the community to prepare them and help them to recover from impacts."

Explanation: This context answers the question as it clearly shows that the document acknowledges the increased vulnerability of certain sectors of the community to the impacts of climate change. It also outlines their plan to focus on resilience planning for these groups.

## Answer
Short answer: 2: Adequately

Long answer: The document recognises the need for focused planning for vulnerable sectors of the community, particularly in relation to urban heat, infrastructure outages, and sudden events. It acknowledges that older people and those living in social isolation could be more vulnerable to climate change impacts. The document also notes the need for further research to identify and quantify the needs of other vulnerable groups such as those with pre-existing health conditions, the elderly, culturally and linguistically diverse communities, and those from lower socio-economic demographics. 

Context: "Vulnerable sectors of the community will require focused resilience planning especially for urban heat, infrastructure outages and sudden events. Vulnerable residents are expected to be the most exposed and Council will need to activate the community to prepare them and help them to recover from impacts. [...] Further research is required to quantify and identify residents who belong to more vulnerable groups including those with pre-existing health conditions, the elderly, culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) communities and lower socio-economic demographics."

Explanation: This context answers the question because it demonstrates that the document acknowledges the specific impacts of climate change on vulnerable communities, and outlines the need for further research and focused planning to support these groups.

## Answer
Short answer: 2: Adequately

Long answer: The document addresses the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities by identifying that an ageing population and social isolation are likely to contribute significantly to vulnerability. It also acknowledges that these sectors of the community will require focused resilience planning especially for urban heat, infrastructure outages and sudden events.

Context: "The ageing population and social isolation – 31.7% of residents live in a single/lone person household - are likely to be the two biggest contributors to vulnerability...Vulnerable sectors of the community will require focused resilience planning especially for urban heat, infrastructure outages and sudden events. Vulnerable residents are expected to be the most exposed and Council will need to activate the community to prepare them and help them to recover from impacts."

Explanation: This context answers the question as it specifically mentions vulnerable communities (in this case, an ageing population and socially isolated individuals) and discusses how they will be impacted by climate change. The document acknowledges that these groups are likely to be the most exposed to the effects of climate change and will require focused resilience planning. This shows an understanding that climate change disproportionately affects certain groups and a plan to address this inequity.
