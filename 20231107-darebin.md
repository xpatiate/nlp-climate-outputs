## Answer
Short answer: Thoroughly

Long answer: The document thoroughly states the 'what' and the 'why' of a climate emergency response. It outlines the urgent need for local government and the community to take action against climate change. The document explains that the climate is changing rapidly with an unprecedented rate of warming, leading to devastating impacts on Australia’s coral reefs, mangrove forests and marine kelp forests. It warns that there are already climate refugees and that millions of people are in danger of being displaced, with conflicts around the world being linked to climate change impacts such as drought.

Context: "Our climate is changing rapidly. The past few decades have seen an unprecedented rate of warming... The Australian public seem to be relatively aware. So why isn’t more being done? 90% of Australians believe responsibility rests with the federal government to at least do part of the work to address climate change, with 67% thinking the federal government should take the leading role. And only 19% consider the Australian government to be doing a good job in this regard, with 33% viewing their performance as fairly poor or terrible."

Explanation: This context answers the question by providing a comprehensive explanation of the urgency and necessity of a climate emergency response. It highlights the significant impacts of climate change and the need for government action. It further emphasizes the role of local government in taking action and leading the way in the climate emergency response.
