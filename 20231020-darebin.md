## Answer
**Yes**, the document does state the 'what' and 'why' of a climate emergency response, albeit not explicitly. The 'why' of a climate emergency response is recognized as the emergency situation with potentially dramatic and negative impacts on our community and around the world. The 'what' is implied to be the urgent restoration of a safe climate, and a shift from 'business as usual' to an emergency mindset. However, it is also acknowledged that the document does not provide a clear definition or direct explanation of what constitutes a climate emergency response or why such a response is necessary, suggesting a recognized lack of clarity among the public about what actions they could be taking to respond to climate change.

## Answer
**Yes**, the document does plainly state who is responsible for action. It clearly outlines that the Council, the State and Federal Governments, and the Darebin community (which includes households, businesses, schools, organisations, groups, etc) are all responsible for various actions. These actions range from establishing and supporting the Climate Emergency Darebin to providing funding and considering joining the board or the Climate Think Tank. The local government is primarily responsible for advocating for and implementing the actions outlined in the policy. Each entity is given specific tasks and responsibilities, clearly stating who is responsible for action towards climate change efforts.

# Question 2: Does the document enable organisations as well as the communities they serve to mobilise behind a clear purpose of action?

## Answer
**Yes**, the document does enable organisations as well as the communities they serve to mobilise behind a clear purpose of action. This is evident as the strategies and policies in the plan aim to promote action not just among individuals but also among organisations. The document encourages both individuals and organisations to take action, with the council showing a commitment to supporting the community in adapting to climate change. Moreover, it encourages individuals to be conscious consumers, which could imply a call to action for organisations to ensure they have satisfactory policies on fossil fuel divestment. The document also outlines the role of local government in advocating for the needs of local communities, indicating a clear purpose of action for organisations. Furthermore, it encourages community action such as increasing tree coverage and supporting council programs. The local government is also creating an initiative that involves residents, businesses, education institutions, and other organisations to engage them in taking action on the climate emergency challenge. All these aspects demonstrate that the document indeed enables both organisations and communities to mobilise for climate action.

## Answer
**Yes**, the document necessitates rapid action. It plainly states that a state of emergency, or rapid action, is required to avoid catastrophic climate change, and that the usual pace of change is insufficient for the scale of the issue. It specifically mentions "emergency speed action," indicating the need for rapid implementation and possibly adjustments to the plan. It also highlights the urgency of the situation by stating that it's vital to plan for the ongoing effects of climate change while also working to eliminate emissions. The document directly states that we are in a state of climate emergency and that a safe climate must be restored at "emergency speed". This implies that rapid action is needed to prevent negative impacts.

# Question 4: Does the document state that climate emergency actions have socio-governmental priority?

## Answer
The document does not explicitly state that climate emergency actions have socio-governmental priority. However, it does highlight that a majority of Australians believe the government has a responsibility to address climate change, indicating a socio-governmental priority. The document also outlines several strategies and actions the local government is taking to address climate change, further supporting the idea of climate emergency actions having socio-governmental priority. On the other hand, the document also suggests that the federal government is seen as failing to provide adequate policies for climate safety, which could be interpreted as the government not prioritizing climate emergency actions.

# Question 5: Does the document ensure that a climate emergency response is prioritised over policies incompatible with radical decarbonisation?

## Answer
The document does not explicitly ensure that a climate emergency response is prioritised over policies incompatible with radical decarbonisation. While it outlines the urgent need for action on climate change and mentions the concept of a "Climate Emergency response", it does not specifically state that this response is to be prioritised over policies that might not align with radical decarbonisation. The context provided does not include information about prioritising a climate emergency response over other policies. Despite outlining a number of initiatives to tackle climate change and promote environmental sustainability, there is no direct mention of a hierarchy of priorities in relation to these policies.

## Answer
**Yes**, the plan does allocate available discretionary funds and other institutional resources towards action to ensure delivery of the objective. This is evident in the plan's commitment to invest in fossil-free financial institutions, partner with agencies for community programs and grants, and consider waste service charges or incentives. Additionally, the Council provides community grants for projects that align with their sustainability objectives, and supports groups in seeking additional funding. However, the document does not provide specific information on the allocation of technical capacity and technological assets.

## Answer
**Yes**, the plan actively empowers the community to rally, support, and work productively together to deliver climate action. This is exemplified through initiatives such as the Sustainable Homes and Communities Program, which empowers residents and community groups to lead and deliver positive environmental initiatives. Strategies for community engagement and building climate awareness are also incorporated into the plan, alongside financial support for sustainability and resilience initiatives. Furthermore, the plan facilitates a climate think tank to develop local zero emissions and resilience proposals and solutions, harnesses and encourages community participation and investment, and develops programs that educate and mobilise the community. In these ways, the plan not only supports but actively encourages the community to work together to deliver climate action.

# Question 8: Does the plan include far-reaching mitigative efforts to restore a safe, decarbonised climate to rapidly address the causes of the climate emergency?

## Answer
**Yes**, the document encourages societal, economic, environmental and cultural transformations. This is demonstrated through local government's commitment to societal and environmental transformation through community engagement in environmental initiatives, such as the Sustainable Homes and Communities Program, which also represent economic transformations through partnerships and programs. The document encourages economic transformation by supporting green businesses and providing grants for sustainable and resilient neighbourhoods. Environmental transformation is promoted by initiatives like the Greening Google Maps project to encourage sustainable transport choices, and the energy efficiency program for buildings. A societal and economic transformation is also advocated for through a drastic shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy, which would require a cultural shift in how energy is perceived and used. Further, societal transformations are encouraged through community engagement programs and educational initiatives on waste reduction and recycling, while economic transformations are suggested through the investigation of waste service charges and incentives. Environmental transformations are promoted by actions such as waste reduction, recycling, and fossil fuel divestment, and cultural transformations are encouraged by pushing for changes in consumption and waste habits, as well as in investment practices.
