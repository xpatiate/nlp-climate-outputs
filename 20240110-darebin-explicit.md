## Purpose of action
### With regard to 'purpose of action': Does the document explicitly define 'climate emergency' and if so, how?
* __Positive__: True
* __Answer__: The document does define 'climate emergency'. It refers to 'climate emergency' as both the state of emergency due to global warming, melting polar ice caps, rising sea levels and undermining food and water security, and as a specific approach to tackling climate change. This approach involves taking action to influence other levels of government, industries, and organisations that have the greatest power to take urgent and appropriate action to respond to the climate emergency.
* __Quote__: Climate Emergency: Climate 
Emergency refers both to the 
state of emergency described  
in section 3, and to a specific 
approach to tackling climate 
change, i.e

## Restoring a safe climate
### With regard to 'restoring a safe climate': Does the plan include specific actions for mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, including technological solutions and behaviour change? If so, please list as many as possible.
* __Positive__: True
* __Answer__: The plan does indeed include specific actions for mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, both through technological solutions and behaviour change. Technological solutions include the use of solar panels, which are a zero emissions source of energy, and home insulation, which reduces energy use. Recycling food waste through composting is also mentioned as a way to reduce organic waste to landfill and associated greenhouse gas emissions. Behaviour change is encouraged through actions such as growing and sourcing food locally, which can help reduce reliance on the greenhouse-gas-intensive globalised food system. The plan also outlines nine key directions to reach their goals, which include energy efficiency, renewable energy and fuel switching, consumption and waste minimisation, and fossil fuel divestment.
