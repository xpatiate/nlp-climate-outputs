## Answer
Short answer: 2: Adequately

Long answer: The document adequately addresses the issue of 'institutional resource mobilisation' by outlining specific budget allocations and funding strategies for various climate action initiatives. The document details the allocation of funds for various projects, such as the $1 million proposed for the Council building energy efficiency fund over the 5-year plan period, and the $427,000 budget allocation for the Climate Emergency plan implementation. However, while the document does outline these allocations, it doesn't provide a comprehensive overview of how all available discretionary funds and other institutional resources are being mobilised towards climate action.

Context: "Capital funding to be considered in the annual budget include: –   Council building energy efficiency fund – $1 million is proposed over the 5-year plan period. These works would have a minimum 10-year payback in reduced energy costs. The current budget allocation for the Climate Emergency plan implementation is $427,000 including $127,000 for direct programs and $300,000 for the purchase of GreenPower (paid across the organisation as part of electricity purchase.) This funding will be reapportioned in line with recommended strategic directions."

Explanation: This context is relevant as it provides specific examples of how the local government is allocating funds for climate action initiatives, demonstrating their commitment to mobilising institutional resources towards addressing climate change.

## Answer
Short answer: 3: Thoroughly

Long answer: The Darebin Climate Emergency Plan 2017-2022 thoroughly addresses the need for adapting to a changing climate through a range of specific targets and actions. The plan outlines strategies to increase climate resilience in different sectors, invest in housing designs that minimize the impact of extreme temperatures, and manage the effects of climate change-induced flooding. The document also includes actions to create a flood and drought resilient city and to implement community-based food systems that reduce reliance on the carbon-intensive global food system. It also provides measures to enhance community capacity to support one another during extreme events. 

Context: "Create a flood and drought resilient city through integrated solutions to water management. Implement community-based local food systems which reduce reliance on the carbon-intensive global food system. Enhance and increase the community capacity to support one another during extreme events."

Explanation: This context is relevant because it provides specific examples of how the plan addresses climate adaptation through the development of resilience strategies. It shows that the plan not only recognizes the need for adaptation but also provides concrete measures to achieve it.

Short answer: 2: Adequately

Long answer: The document seems to be based on current scientific data and the understanding of climate change, and it outlines a number of actions and targets in response to this. It includes a range of strategies and actions to mitigate climate change, such as reducing waste, increasing use of renewable energy, and enhancing community capacity to support one another during extreme events. However, it is not explicitly stated that these actions and targets are based on scientific data. The document also mentions a major review and evaluation of the plan that will commence in 2021, suggesting some level of monitoring and evaluation capacity. However, it does not detail how this will be done or how it will be based on research.

Context: "The Climate Emergency Plan covers the next five years, from 2017 to 2022. A major review and evaluation of the plan will commence in 2021 and the plan for the next period will be established."

Explanation: This context is relevant as it shows that there is a plan to review and evaluate the actions and strategies outlined in the document, which suggests some level of monitoring and evaluation capacity. However, it does not provide details on how this will be done or how it will be based on research.

## Answer
Short answer: 3: Thoroughly

Long answer: The document thoroughly discusses the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities, emphasizing that they are likely to be the most impacted by the effects of climate change. This is evident in the document's focus on the most disadvantaged and vulnerable in the community who will be most impacted by the effects of climate change such as heatwaves, flood damage to housing, and disruption to essential services. The document also outlines specific demographics that are particularly vulnerable, such as older people, children under 5 years of age, pregnant or nursing mothers, people with pre-existing medical conditions, and people with a disability.

Context: "The most disadvantaged and vulnerable in our community are those who will be most impacted by the effects of climate change (such as heatwaves, flood damage to housing and disruption to essential services) and the least equipped to adapt. Sections of Darebin’s population are significantly more vulnerable to the impacts of heatwaves. These include older people (65 years and older), children under 5 years of age, pregnant or nursing mothers, people with pre-existing medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease or mental illness, and people with a disability."

Explanation: This context is relevant because it directly addresses the question, demonstrating that the document does indeed discuss the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities. The quote highlights the document's recognition of the disproportionate impact of climate change on these communities and outlines specific demographics that are particularly vulnerable.
