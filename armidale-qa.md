# Question: Does the document truthfully state the ‘what’ and the ‘why’ of a climate emergency response?

## Answer
 
**Yes**, the document truthfully states the 'what' and the 'why' of a climate emergency response. Context from the document demonstrates that it acknowledges the urgency of the climate emergency and the need for stronger and more effective action, outlines a plan of action to address the climate emergency, explains why the document is addressing the climate emergency, and outlines the 'why' of a climate emergency response, which is that human-induced climate change is a great threat to humanity and other species, and that urgent action is needed to prevent catastrophic outcomes, as well as the 'what' of a climate emergency response, which is that local councils need to take action.

# Question: Does the document plainly state who is responsible for action?

## Answer
**Yes**, the document plainly states who is responsible for action. The context states that the working group is responsible for recommending actions that the council and community can undertake, gathering a list of current activities and future actions, engaging the community and stakeholders, exploring funding options, and providing relevant content for a report. Additionally, CEWG, ESAC, and Council support staff are responsible for developing a Grant Development Strategy, and the Armidale Regional Council is responsible for the action outlined in the document.

# Question: Does the document enable organisations as well as the communities they serve to mobilise behind a clear purpose of action?

## Answer
**Yes**, the document enables organisations as well as the communities they serve to mobilise behind a clear purpose of action. Context from the document suggests that it encourages the community to take ownership of the issue of climate change, encourages organisations to be inclusive of all members of the community, encourages organisations and communities to engage with climate emergency action, and outlines the need for a leader to facilitate effective cross-departmental action. All of these elements enable organisations and communities to mobilise behind a clear purpose of action.

# Question: Does the document necessitate rapid action?

## Answer
**Yes**, the document necessitates rapid action. Context from the document indicates the urgency of the situation, with a short time frame for action, and the need to reduce the severity of climate change through local action.

# Question: Does the document state that climate emergency actions have socio-governmental priority?

## Answer
**Yes**, the document states that climate emergency actions have socio-governmental priority. Context from the document includes: "The more quickly we act and the more co-ordinated our action is as a community, the more effective our action is likely to be and the less damage and cost in the long term," "An overall strategy consistent with the Climate Emergency Declaration and goals of reducing greenhouse emissions, community adaptation to climate change, and carbon sequestration; Weighting to those actions with the greatest positive effect (particularly in relation to current base level emissions) as well as cost effectiveness; Building on initiatives in progress and/or where groundwork and/or an audit has already been done; Working collaboratively within the existing council framework including the Community Strategic Plan, EcoARC GreenPrints, and with Project Zero30, RGPAAC and SLA and the like," and "That Council therefore declares that we are in a ‘Climate Emergency.' These quotes suggest that the document is prioritizing climate emergency actions, as it states that the quicker and more co-ordinated the action is, the more effective it will be, and that the overall strategy should be consistent with the Climate Emergency Declaration and its goals, and that the actions should be weighted based on their positive effect and cost effectiveness.

# Question: Does the document ensure that a climate emergency response is prioritised over policies incompatible with radical decarbonisation?

## Answer
**Yes**, the document ensures that a climate emergency response is prioritised over policies incompatible with radical decarbonisation. Context from the document suggests that the document is focused on taking action and implementing specific projects, rather than writing more reports, and that it prioritises actions with the greatest positive effect on reducing greenhouse emissions. This implies that the document prioritizes a climate emergency response over policies incompatible with radical decarbonisation.

## Answer
**Yes**, the plan allocates available discretionary funds and other institutional resources such as cost/benefit analysis, infrastructure upgrades, and technical capacity and technological assets towards action to ensure delivery of the objective.

# Question: Does the plan actively empower the community to rally, support, and work productively together to deliver climate action?

## Answer
**Yes**, the plan actively empowers the community to rally, support, and work productively together to deliver climate action. Context from the document outlines the plan's intention to empower the community to take ownership of the issue and make decisions, as well as to influence government on climate issues. It also demonstrates that the local community has already shown support for sustainable living practices, indicating that they are likely to rally, support, and work productively together to deliver climate action. The plan also includes maintaining communication and liaison between the Council and its relevant committees, as well as community groups, in order to empower the community to rally, support, and work productively together to deliver climate action.

# Question: Does the plan include far-reaching mitigative efforts to restore a safe, decarbonised climate in conjunction with climate adaptation actions (occasionally within the resources referred to as ‘building resilience’ or ‘reducing vulnerability’) to rapidly address the causes of the climate emergency and lessen the impacts already being felt?

## Answer
**Yes**, the plan includes far-reaching mitigative efforts to restore a safe, decarbonised climate in conjunction with climate adaptation actions. Context from the document suggests that the plan is focused on taking action and implementing specific projects, rather than simply writing another report, which implies that the plan includes far-reaching mitigative efforts to restore a safe, decarbonised climate in conjunction with climate adaptation actions.

# Question: Does the document encourage societal, economic, environmental and cultural transformations?

## Answer
**Yes**, the document encourages societal, economic, environmental and cultural transformations. Context from the document suggests that it encourages the formation of networks between environmental and community groups, considers the environmental impact of activities, encourages economic transformation by encouraging hi-tech businesses to the region, and encourages action rather than just writing another report. All of these examples demonstrate how the document encourages societal, economic, environmental and cultural transformations.

# Question: Are the plan's targets, actions and monitoring based on current scientific data?

## Answer
**No**, the plan's targets, actions and monitoring are not based on current scientific data. Contexts such as "Baseline the ALGA", "Incorporate the above priority actions into ARC’s operational plan and budget" and "Council is to be congratulated for its most recent agreement to partner with the University of New England (UNE) to undertake Project Zero30, aiming by 2030 for no additional contribution from our region to the global temperature rise" do not provide any information about the plan's targets, actions and monitoring being based on current scientific data. However, the quote "Moving forward with these recommendations means implementing specific projects as suggested throughout – not by writing yet another report" suggests that the plan is based on current scientific data, as it is not necessary to write another report in order to move forward with the recommendations.

# Question: Does the document specify monitoring and evaluation capacity and research dedicated to closing knowledge gaps across varying aspects and developing critical solutions?

## Answer
**Yes**, the document does specify monitoring and evaluation capacity and research dedicated to closing knowledge gaps across varying aspects and developing critical solutions. Contexts such as "Council collaborate with UNE to identify relevant projects for UNE honours, masters and PhD students to facilitate actions identified in the report," "The focus of the Champion will be to plan and facilitate action across the organisation, facilitate ongoing stakeholder engagement, monitor progress and hold people to account, challenge business-as-usual approaches, and help to find beneficial solution," and "We recommend that a Grant Development Strategy be developed between CEWG, ESAC and Council support staff to best utilise available corporate and community knowledge" indicate that the document is dedicated to monitoring and evaluation capacity and research dedicated to closing knowledge gaps across varying aspects and developing critical solutions.

Context from the document includes lobbying for higher standards in building design, advocating for the government to divest from and phase out extraction and supply of fossil fuels, and advocating for stronger and more effective action from state and national governments to address climate change.

# Question: Does the document encourage building local capacity across council, their local communities and neighbouring local councils?

## Answer

**Yes**, the document encourages building local capacity across council, their local communities and neighbouring local councils. This is demonstrated by the document encouraging collaboration between the local government and the University of New England to identify relevant projects for students to facilitate actions identified in the report, as well as facilitating networks and relationships between environmental and community groups, making use of local skills and expertise on climate, and encouraging collaboration between local councils and their local communities, as well as neighbouring local councils, in order to amplify and strengthen initiatives towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, the document encourages communication and liaison between the council and its committees, as well as community groups, which would help to build local capacity.

# Question: Does the document ensure that both the burden of climate emergency action and the opportunities borne from a safe climate are equitably shared across local, national and even international communities?

## Answer

**No**, the document does not ensure that both the burden of climate emergency action and the opportunities borne from a safe climate are equitably shared across local, national and even international communities. The context suggests that the document acknowledges the need for a co-operative response to climate change, but focuses on local action, suppliers and growers, and initiatives, rather than considering the wider national and international communities and the global implications of climate change and how to ensure equitable sharing of the burden and opportunities.
