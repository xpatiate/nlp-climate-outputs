## Answer
Short answer: 2: Adequately

Long answer: The document adequately states the 'what' and the 'why' of a climate emergency response by outlining Council's position on climate change and the objectives of the policy, which include aligning operational and strategic planning with NSW State policy, providing a whole of Council commitment to managing climate change risks within the Cessnock LGA, and supporting community initiatives to deal with climate change. It also outlines the principles and policy commitments that Council will adhere to in order to address climate change.

Context: "This Policy sets out Council’s position on climate change, the objectives of this Policy are to...provide a whole of Council commitment to managing climate change risks within the Cessnock Local Government Area (LGA); support community initiatives to deal with climate change; empower Council as a leader for action on climate change..."

Explanation: This quote from the document clearly outlines the objectives of the policy, including the commitment to managing climate change risks and supporting community initiatives. This demonstrates that the document truthfully states the 'what' and the 'why' of a climate emergency response.

## Answer
Short answer: 1: Partially

Long answer: The document partially calls for rapid and urgent action. While it outlines responsibilities for council officials and sets a three-year review date, it does not explicitly state the need for immediate action in response to climate change.

Context: "Policy Review Date: Three years from date of adoption unless legislated otherwise"

Explanation: The three-year review date suggests that the document does not call for immediate or urgent action, but rather allows for a longer-term approach to addressing climate change. Therefore, the document only partially calls for rapid and urgent action.

# Attribute 3: Prioritisation of action
## Question 1: Does the document state that a climate emergency response must be prioritised over policies incompatible with radical decarbonisation?
### Context

## Answer
Short answer: 0: Not at all

    Long answer: The document does not explicitly state that a climate emergency response must be prioritised over policies incompatible with radical decarbonisation. It primarily focuses on familiarising council officials with the policy, integrating climate change considerations into decision-making, and ensuring compliance with the policy. There is no mention of prioritising a climate emergency response over other policies.

    Context: The document outlines the responsibilities of council officials, the general manager, and directors/managers in implementing and complying with the climate change policy.

    Explanation: The context provided does not address the prioritization of a climate emergency response over policies incompatible with radical decarbonization. Therefore, the document does not provide information on this specific topic.

## Answer
Short answer: 1: Partially

Long answer: The document does not explicitly mention the allocation of discretionary funds or other resources towards action on climate change. However, it does outline the responsibilities of Council Officials, the General Manager, and Directors and Managers in implementing the policy and ensuring compliance. This suggests that there is some level of allocation of institutional resources towards action on climate change, but it is not explicitly stated in the document.

Context: "6.2 The General Manager is responsible for the implementation of this policy and ensuring regular reports are provided to the elected Council."

Explanation: This quote shows that there is a specific role assigned to the General Manager for implementing the policy, which implies some allocation of institutional resources towards action on climate change. However, the document does not provide specific details about the allocation of discretionary funds or technical capacity.

## Answer
Short answer: 2: Adequately

Long answer: The plan actively empowers and educates the community to rally, support, and work productively together to deliver climate action. It outlines the principle of Collaborative Decision Making, which involves partnering with the community, business, and other stakeholders in planning and implementing climate change actions through learning and shared responsibility. It also includes support for initiatives and education programs to enhance the community’s understanding and resilience to climate change risks. This demonstrates an effort to actively involve and empower the community in addressing climate change.

## Answer
Short answer: 1: Partially

Long answer: The plan includes some mitigative efforts, such as the consideration of climate change in decision making and day-to-day operations, as well as the integration of principles and policy commitments into operations and decision making processes. However, the document does not explicitly outline far-reaching actions to rapidly address the causes of the climate emergency.

Context: "Climate Mitigation means consideration of the actions to reduce the impacts of climate change."

Explanation: This context shows that the document does address climate mitigation, but it does not explicitly mention far-reaching efforts to rapidly address the causes of the climate emergency. Therefore, the plan only partially includes mitigative efforts to restore a safe, decarbonised climate.
