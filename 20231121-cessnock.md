## Answer
Short answer: 1: Partially

Long answer: The document does not explicitly call for rapid and urgent action on climate change. However, it does highlight the importance of taking action on climate change, and outlines a number of principles and strategies to guide the council's efforts in this area. These include improving energy efficiency, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, collaborating with the community and other stakeholders, and continually evolving the council's response to climate change. 

Context: "Principle 3: Council implement a program of Continuous Improvement in relation to improving energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Principle 4: Council implement Evidence Based decision making to respond, to adapt and build resilience to climate change. Recognising the need for continually evolving response to the threat of climate change."

Explanation: This context is relevant because it shows that the council acknowledges the ongoing threat of climate change and has plans in place to respond to it. However, the language used does not convey a sense of urgency or immediate action.

## Answer
Short answer: 1: Partially

Long answer: The document does not directly mention the allocation of discretionary funds or other institutional resources towards climate action. However, it does indicate a commitment to various initiatives that would require resources, such as implementing a program of continuous improvement for energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions, preparing a Renewable Energy Strategy, and reviewing and updating the Council's Carbon Management & Energy Reduction Strategy.

Context: "Principle 3: Council implement a program of Continuous Improvement in relation to improving energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions." and "5.1.4.3 Prepare a Renewable Energy Strategy to encourage government and private sector investment in renewable energy projects (in suitable locations) and encourage the renewal of Council’s energy using asset."

Explanation: These initiatives, among others mentioned in the document, imply that resources will be allocated to climate action. However, the document does not specify the source of these resources, whether they are discretionary funds or other types of institutional resources.

## Answer
Short answer: 2: Adequately

Long answer: The document addresses the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions by outlining a plan to achieve zero net emissions by 2050, in line with the NSW Government’s target. The council aims to integrate principles of Ecologically Sustainable Development into its operations and decision making, which includes improving energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions as a continuous improvement program. However, the document does not provide specific details on the technologies or sustainable practices that will be used to achieve these goals.

Context: "This Policy demonstrates that Council is meeting its State legislative obligations in regards to climate change, by adopting the NSW Government’s target of achieving zero net emissions by 2050." and "Principle 3: Council implement a program of Continuous Improvement in relation to improving energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions."

Explanation: These excerpts show that the council has a target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and a principle in place for improving energy efficiency. However, the lack of specific actions or technologies mentioned indicates that the plan is not thoroughly addressing the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions.

## Answer
Short answer: 2: Adequately

Long answer: The document adequately addresses the subject of 'coordination, partnerships and advocacy for action'. It specifically mentions the importance of shared responsibility across all levels of government, council, community and businesses in addressing climate change. It also talks about engaging with the community and other stakeholders in the development of the Climate Change Strategy, and establishing partnerships between Council and the community. However, there is no explicit mention of advocating upward to state and national governments to support radical action.

Context: "5.1.1.3 Recognise the importance of shared responsibility across all levels of government, Council, community and businesses in addressing climate change and transitioning towards a net zero emissions region. 5.1.2.1 Engage with the community and other stakeholders in the development of the Climate Change Strategy. 5.1.2.2 Establish partnerships between Council and the community with the goal of identifying investment opportunities for economic stability and sustainable growth."

Explanation: This context is relevant because it shows that the document does address the importance of coordination, partnerships and advocacy for action in relation to climate change. However, it does not explicitly mention advocating for radical action to higher levels of government.
