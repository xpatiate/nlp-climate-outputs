> _____________________________________________ Cessnock City Council Climate Change Policy Date Adopted xx/xx/2020 Revision: 1 _____________________________________________ 1. POLICY OBJECTIVE...


## Answer
The document appears to advocate for both a measured, long-term approach and rapid action. It outlines a plan for incremental changes leading up to a net zero emissions target by 2050, suggesting a measured, long-term strategy. However, it also emphasizes the "precautionary principle," advocating for action to prevent environmental damage even in the absence of complete scientific certainty. This principle implies a sense of urgency or rapid action. Additionally, the document states that a Climate Change Strategy should be developed by June 2021, further reinforcing this sense of urgency. Therefore, while the document may not explicitly urge rapid action, it does encourage a proactive and timely response to climate change.
