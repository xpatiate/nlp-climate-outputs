## Answer
Short answer: 2: Adequately

Long answer: The document adequately addresses the 'what' and 'why' of a climate emergency response. It outlines the purpose of action as being to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, prepare the city for the impacts of a changing climate, and achieve a range of important benefits like healthier people, cleaner air and water, and stronger communities and economies. The document also states that Auckland Council will take the lead role in coordinating and developing the framework, but that it will also rely on other organisations and sectors to deliver some of the actions.

Context: "Auckland Council has committed to facilitating the development of Auckland’s Climate Action Framework. It will steer the region on a path toward rapidly reducing greenhouse gas emissions and preparing the city for the impacts of a changing climate." and "Auckland Council took the lead role of coordinating and developing this framework. It will own and deliver some of the actions. It will enable and partner on others. Other organisations and sectors will be responsible for owning and delivering the rest of the actions."

Explanation: These quotes show that the document clearly outlines the purpose of the climate emergency response and who is responsible for taking action. The first quote explains the 'what' and 'why' of the response, while the second quote outlines who will be responsible for implementing the actions.

## Answer
Short answer: 3: Thoroughly

Long answer: The document thoroughly addresses the issue of adapting to a changing climate. It presents a comprehensive framework that includes specific targets and actions for climate adaptation, often referring to this as 'building resilience' or 'reducing vulnerability'. The plan includes actions such as enhancing ecosystem services and connectivity, making development and infrastructure climate-compatible, shifting to decentralised renewable energy, transforming existing buildings and places, delivering clean, efficient and accessible mobility options, future-proofing communities and empowering individual action. The document also outlines the importance of prioritising and testing these actions, and engaging with various stakeholders in their development and implementation.

Context: "Climate resilience is being climate-ready. It means anticipating, absorbing, accommodating or recovering from the impacts of climate change.  It means that our people, infrastructure, places and economy are prepared. Done well, it means more than “bouncing back” – it means “bouncing forward.”

Explanation: This context is relevant as it defines what climate resilience means in the plan, which is essentially about adapting to a changing climate. It highlights that this involves not just recovering from the impacts of climate change, but also anticipating, absorbing, and accommodating these impacts. It also underscores that this resilience extends to people, infrastructure, places, and the economy, which indicates a comprehensive approach to climate adaptation.

Long answer: The document thoroughly discusses the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities, emphasizing the need for a just transition that is fair, equitable, and inclusive. It acknowledges that the ability of people and households to prepare, adapt, and respond to the effects of climate change depends on factors such as where people live, their health and income, and their support networks. The document also highlights the importance of prioritizing more vulnerable people and communities in preparing for climate change impacts.

Context: "The ability of people and households to prepare, adapt and respond to the effects of climate change depends on where people live, their health and income, and their support networks." and "A just transition is one that is fair, equitable and inclusive."

Explanation: These quotes demonstrate the document's recognition of the differential impacts of climate change on different communities, particularly vulnerable ones. It underscores the importance of equity and social justice in the context of climate change, advocating for a just transition that minimally impacts these communities and provides them with the necessary support to adapt and respond to climate change.
