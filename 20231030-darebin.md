## Answer
**Yes**, the document does truthfully state the 'what' and the 'why' of a climate emergency response. The document recognizes the current state of climate emergency and expresses the need for swift action to restore a safe climate, which represents the 'what'. The reason for this response, or the 'why', is to prevent dramatic and negative impacts on the community and the world. The document also defines the 'what' as moving into an 'emergency mode' of action, and the 'why' as avoiding catastrophic climate change and restoring a safe climate, emphasizing that standard procedures and small improvements are insufficient. However, it should be noted that in some parts of the document, the 'why' behind the climate emergency response is not explicitly stated, even though the 'what' is discussed.
