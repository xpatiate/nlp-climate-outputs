## Answer
**Yes**, the document truthfully states the 'what' and 'why' of a climate emergency response. The 'what' of a climate emergency response is articulated through the community's call for the council to take urgent action to address global warming and its impacts, the need for a coordinated community response, the need for urgent action by all levels of government, including local councils, and a report listing actions for the Council to take. The 'why' is explained as the necessity for such action to be taken quickly and effectively to minimize damage and costs in the long term, the great threat human-induced climate change poses to humanity, civilization and other species, and the need to restore a safe climate as the climate is in crisis. These quotes from the document provide a clear and truthful explanation of what a climate emergency response is and why it is necessary.

## Answer
**Yes**, the document plainly states who is responsible for action. The Environmental Sustainability Advisory Committee (ESAC) and Council’s Sustainability Officer are assigned the responsibility of implementing the recommendations and converting them into real actions. Moreover, the Council’s Sustainability Officer is specifically tasked with pursuing funding opportunities related to climate change action. The document also emphasizes the need for an all-of-community response, indicating that various parties, including the local community, the council, national and sub-national authorities, civil society, the private sector, indigenous peoples, and local communities share the responsibility. Additionally, the Armidale Regional Council (ARC) adopted a Climate Emergency Declaration, implying their responsibility for taking action against climate change according to the policy.

## Answer
The document implies that climate emergency actions have socio-governmental priority but does not explicitly state it. There are sections that suggest that all of the council's decisions should be guided by the Climate Emergency Declaration, indicating that it is a priority for the local government. More specifically, the council's planning and strategy aim to make the climate planning framework coherent, and prioritize climate change action above other actions. However, there are parts of the document that do not contain any information or indications that the climate emergency actions have socio-governmental priority.

## Answer
The document does express strong advocacy for action towards reducing global warming and indicates that the council's strategy is to prioritise climate change action, implying these actions would take precedence over other policies, including those that might be incompatible with radical decarbonisation. It is also stated that the Climate Emergency should be incorporated into the Community Strategic Plan and that transitioning to zero carbon emissions by 2030 should be a planning priority. However, the document does not explicitly ensure that a climate emergency response is prioritised over policies incompatible with radical decarbonisation. While the climate emergency and the need for action is acknowledged, it is not explicitly stated that this response takes precedence over other policies not aligned with drastic carbon reduction. Therefore, the document appears to lean towards prioritising a climate emergency response over incompatible policies, but doesn't provide a clear guarantee of this prioritisation.

## Answer
The document does not provide specific information on whether the plan allocates available discretionary funds and other institutional resources such as technical capacity and technological assets towards action to ensure delivery of the objective. The context suggests that funding could be sought from the state government, and previous programs could be revisited, but it does not mention using existing discretionary funds or institutional resources. However, one part of the text does indicate that the local government is committed to allocate financial resources for actions to address climate change issues, with equal importance given to social and environmental aspects. This suggests a shift from business as usual towards a more environmentally conscious approach. So, while the plan does show some commitment towards allocation of resources, it does not explicitly mention the allocation of discretionary funds or other institutional resources for ensuring the delivery of the objective.

## Answer
**Yes**, the plan actively empowers the community to rally, support, and work productively together to deliver climate action. The plan is designed to engage with residents, businesses, and institutions, fostering a whole-of-community involvement in the climate action process. It includes strategies such as educating, raising awareness, facilitating discussions and actions, supporting proactive actions through better planning and rebates, and conducting community engagement activities like community days. The plan's goal is to build local engagement and empower the community to take action and be proactive towards the climate emergency, indicating a communal rally and support for climate action.

## Answer
**Yes**, the plan does include far-reaching mitigative efforts to restore a safe, decarbonised climate in conjunction with climate adaptation actions to rapidly address the causes of the climate emergency and lessen the impacts already being felt. The plan outlines a range of actions including upgrading infrastructure to cope with changing weather patterns, encouraging good building design, lobbying for higher building standards, and encouraging regenerative farming practices. These actions aim to reduce the impacts of climate change and build resilience. Additionally, the plan identifies transitioning to zero carbon emissions by 2030 as a part of their response to the climate emergency, indicating a significant mitigation effort. However, while the document does focus on understanding the impacts and consequences of climate change, and preparing for them, it does not provide specific details about some of the mitigative efforts.

## Answer
**Yes**, the document encourages societal, economic, environmental, and cultural transformations. The text outlines a variety of actions and policies proposed by the local government in response to climate change. These include educational initiatives for better building design (societal), incentives for water saving and storage (economic), planting of food trees and preferential use of local suppliers (environmental), and changes to regulations around community gardens and local suppliers (cultural). It also encourages a whole-of-community transformation, which includes societal changes through engaging local businesses and institutions, economic changes through fiscal responsibility and environmental changes through supporting the transformation of local agricultural practices, and a cultural transformation by empowering the Indigenous residents. The document also advocates for the consideration of social and environmental impacts alongside fiscal ones in decision-making processes (environmental) and recognizes the importance of engaging with Indigenous communities and incorporating their land-management practices in climate action strategies (cultural). Lastly, it states that all principles, including societal, economic, environmental, and cultural, should be guided by the Climate Emergency Declaration, implying that these areas should all be influenced by the need for climate change mitigation and adaptation.

## Answer
**Yes**, the plan does prescribe coordinated efforts between all sectors. The plan mentions combined efforts and cooperation among different sectors such as the Council, the Community, and the State Government. It emphasizes the importance of engaging with residents, businesses (including agricultural producers), and institutions. This comprehensive approach indicates that all sectors are involved in addressing climate change. Furthermore, the policy involves local businesses, Council staff, and other institutions in climate action, showing planned coordination between different sectors. The Council must also ensure that all its departments and sectors are in line with climate action, and that there is collaboration with a variety of stakeholders, including universities, other projects, and the community. This suggests a coordinated effort across multiple sectors. The process should involve engagement and collaboration between all sectors of the community, including council members, staff, residents, businesses, and educational institutions.

## Answer
**Yes**, the document does include advocating upward to state and national governments to support radical action. The Council plans to use its networks to strengthen the response of other councils and lay the groundwork for climate action at higher levels of government. There is also an intent to advocate for radical action on climate change, specifically the phasing out of fossil fuel extraction and supply, at the national level. Moreover, it is directly stated that the Council will lobby State and Federal Governments for urgent action, which implies advocacy for more aggressive measures to tackle climate change. However, it should be noted that there are parts of the document that primarily focus on local actions and strategies for addressing climate change without explicit mention of advocating to higher levels of government for support on radical action.

## Answer
**Yes**, the document does encourage building local capacity across council, their local communities and neighbouring local councils. The document promotes education programs and the encouragement of best practices for good building design. It also promotes engagement and collaboration with local businesses, institutions, and the council staff. It encourages the implementation of sustainable practices, which include supporting local businesses and skills as well as incorporating environmentally beneficial measures into new developments. Furthermore, it encourages community engagement and action on climate issues, suggests working with local Chambers of Commerce and TAFE to spread information and develop green skills, and promotes regular reporting to ensure progress. However, it should be noted that the encouragement of building local capacity is not explicitly stated in the document.

## Answer
The document does not explicitly ensure that both the burden of climate emergency action and the opportunities borne from a safe climate are equitably shared across local, national, and international communities. The document outlines actions to be taken at a local level by the council and the community in partnership with the state government, and it plans to involve local businesses, council staff, and other institutions in cutting emissions and supporting a community-wide transformation. However, it does not directly address the equitable sharing of the burden and opportunities of climate action across local, national, and international communities. While the document suggests that the responsibility for action is not being placed on just one sector or group, it does not specifically discuss how this burden and the benefits of action will be distributed equitably across different communities at local, national, and international levels.
